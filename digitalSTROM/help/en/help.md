## Description

The digitalSTROM dizmos can not only be used to call digitalSTROM scenes with buttons and scene dizmos, but they can also be used to configure digitalSTROM! 

If for example a light is in the wrong room in the digitalSTROM configuration, simply start the two zone dizmos, and drag the device from one room to another, and your digitalSTROM configuration will be changed accordingly! 

Use the settings of the scene dizmo to programm your digitalSTROM scenes. Set values for devices with the device dizmos of a zone, and save the scenes in the scene dizmo.
